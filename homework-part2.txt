i. We can brain-storm with other classmates on homeworks but we cannot collaborate code. Regardless if we brainstorm
or not, we need to have a reference file specifically saying "I did not collaborate with anyone". 
ii. We can consult external sources, we just have to cite them in our references txt file. The only external source 
we cannot use is ChatGPT and AI tools.
